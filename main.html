  <h2>Fermi Pasta Ulam: the paradox that launched scientific computing</h2>

  <div class="left_col">

    <span class="firstcharacter">1</span> In the 1950s the most
    powerful computer in the world, the
    <span class="pz_text" ref="maniac_note">MANIAC</span>, turned to
    the problem of vibrations in a lattice (<span class="pz_text"
    ref="browser_note">as your __browser__ is now</span>).  The model
    was simple---equal masses connected by nonlinear springs.  (Red
    masses are faster.)

  <div class="right_col">
    <span class="firstcharacter">2</span> So began a scientific
    revolution---computer simulation of mathematical and physical
    systems. And there was more. The system displayed *extraordinary
    and unexpected behaviour*:
    <span class="pz_text" ref="fpu_note">the FPU paradox</span>.

    Often called the
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi-Pasta-Ulam_problem, FPU
    __problem__], but initially regarded as a baffling paradox.

  <div class="left_col">
    <span class="firstcharacter">3</span> The researchers expected the
    system's energy to "thermalize"---to (ultimately) spread evenly
    among every harmonic.  But, by chance, they discovered that it
    didn't.
  </div>

  <div class="right_col">
    <span class="firstcharacter">4</span> Instead, they found that the
    initial condition repeated (somewhat) periodically. The resolution
    of the paradox lead to two jewels of nonlinear theory: [b00f0,
    solitons] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory, chaos].
